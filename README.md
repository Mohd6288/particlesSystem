# particlesSystem
 Interactive Particle System in C++
Overview

This project features an interactive particle system developed in C++. It combines principles of computer graphics, user interaction, and physics to create a dynamic and visually appealing simulation. Users can interact with the system in real-time, adjusting various parameters to explore and understand the intricacies of particle dynamics and color theory.
Features

    Dynamic Particle Emission: Simulates particle motion with adjustable properties like speed, size, and lifespan.
    Real-time Interaction: Allows users to interact via mouse and keyboard, influencing particle behavior and visual patterns.
    Color Manipulation: Users can modify the color of particles in real-time, providing a hands-on experience with color theory.
    GUI Controls: An intuitive graphical user interface for easy manipulation of particle system parameters.
    Educational Content: Offers an engaging way to learn about particle systems, physics, and digital art.
